# RPG Tuition C/C++ Tutorial Files

**What is this?**

Prelim is a simple collection of heavily commented C/C++ tutorial files that I use in my computer science teaching. 
I run an online tuition business (RPG Tuition) where I teach Music, Mathematics and Computer Science, and these files 
serve both as an introduction to C/C++ and repositories where you can upload and maintain code.  

**How is the project organised?**

These are really simple programs, basically used to demonstrate key concepts in the C/C++ languages. Comments in the files serve as
prompts and 'thinkers' for my pupils. Each folder is a topic with all the files contained within. There should be no dependencies contained
in other folders.

**How do I get to use them?**

1) Download or Clone
2) Compile 
3) Run 

TODO: Instructions for different platforms

**Can I contribrute?**

Yes, however, I am not looking for contributions at this stage to the repo itself, but if you see any glaring mistakes in terminology; argument vs parameter, 
define vs declare, for example, please do let me know. The devil is deffo in the detail! Also, I am willing to hear from anyone who might know which license might be acceptable - if any. (See below). 

**Licensing**

You are free to do as you please with these. Use them in your learning, or in your teaching, I ain't fussed. 
I am still trying to get my head around all the in and outs of licensing, so there may be a license that it suitable and sets terms that I am happy with, but untill then, its fair game. (As mentioned above, if anyone does know what license will be suitable, I'm all ears!)

C++ learning/tutorial file resources for my teaching. 

**A note on my use of //comments** 

If I may speak from a personal perspective; what I find really useful when learning new subjects, is to have a fixed point of reference. This makes comparisions 
and differences easier to place into context, and thus, has the potential to really speed up ones learning process. Due to this, readers of this repo may find 
the comments within this code possibly overly verbose and quite overbearing as they are intended to help my students place the code contained into the 
proper context. Please keep this in mind whilst reading the code. 

Most of the students reading these files have only experience of python and/or (a third parties) pseudocode so the practices of explicitly declaring types 
(and even considering them at all) and working with pointers will be new to them. 

For some, this will be the first time that they will have seen classes and objects etc programmed in this fine a detail.

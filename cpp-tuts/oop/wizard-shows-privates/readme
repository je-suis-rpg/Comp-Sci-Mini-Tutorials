In this folder I changed the data members of the 
wizard class (the only class that it is actaully 
defined in this folder, actually) to private. 

This was to observe the effects during compilation. 

Before the compiler through up an error, now the code 
can access the private members of the object because
we will have implemented a SAFER class interface with
functions that we have implemented that is 'our' 
defined route of being able to change (and read) whatever
is in that member at that time. 

eg. 

Wizard::setArmor(10);

rather than,

wiz0.mArmour = 10;  

This now works and with the right amount of object reuse too!
